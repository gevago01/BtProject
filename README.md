# BtProject
A program which, given details of the organisational chart and the names of two people, prints out the names of all the
people in the chain between them. A list of employees will be provided in a text file, one employee per line. An example of this text file can be found in this repository (/atchm_3803.txt).
  
The program will be run like this:
Organization atchm_3803.txt "Batman" "Super Ted"

The appplication was developed using the IntelliJ IDEA 14. The project can be imported by both Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea IDE. It can also be run on any Operating System and command line console.
